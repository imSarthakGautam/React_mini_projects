# Learning_react
This is the repository consisting of working with React.
and my self React notes.

React is a library it consists of :
- `react-dom` - for web workings
- `react-native` - for mobile workings


 * METHOD 1
### `npx create-react-app`
- basic method of creating React app.
- It's a slower method however.

 
Ackronyms :
- npm: node package manager
- npx: node package executor
- create-react-app :utility

### package.json
- entry point of react project
- has name of project, version, dependencies, scripts ( run the project, start, build, test) & browserlist.

- to run the project - start script
npm start <--or-->
### `npm run start`

[Note: react has SEO problem ]

- npm run build
- js, this folder is the actually served in production




* METHOD 2
### Vite- react bundler
through this we make react app

- Unlike in create-react app there are no node modules initially.
So we have to :
### npm i
or `npm install`

#### `npm run dev`


- index.html :  
Main Single page of application 

- index.js or main.js :
entry pt of react


* package .json
  vitereact app doesn't contain the react scripts unlike create-react app.

- in ViteReact app : .jsx is used instead of .js like in create-react-app

* Best Pracitces :
- capatilized names of Components
- Few libraries force you to have .jsx in components





### Configuring Tailwind

- `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` :
_-D refers to dev Dependencies_

- `npx tailwind init -p`:
forms _tailwind.config.js_ file

### Had error of not loading tailwind css initially 
- in tailwind.config.js :
```
content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
```
-_this line solved my error_

- Also

```
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

### React Props
- arguments passed into React components, Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.
- passed inside the curly braces {}

### React Components
- reusuable portions of code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements
- export default function _ComponentName_(){}
- Here, default represents the main function of the component.

### Virtual DOM and React Fiber
Virtual DOM is replica of actual DOM
Stops instantenous reloading/re-rendering of page for minor changes in a page, since not every update has to be applied immediately.
Eg: Updates like animation have different priorities than textual changes

## React Hooks

- useState
- useCallback
- useRef
- useEffect
